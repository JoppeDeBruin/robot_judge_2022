## Notes on reading week 8

This paper assesses the impact of Fox News reporting on the behaviour of people curing the COVID19 pandemic.

It positions itself in the literature by claiming that previous papers have mainly focused on low-stakes environments, while this paper focuses on a very high-stakes environment during the biggest pandamic decades. 

The main challenge that the paper deals with is that viewership of FNC might have very different characteristics than people not watching shows on the network (selection bias). 

Hence an IV design is used to identify the causal effect. The instrument that is used here is the channel's position on the cable system (randomly determined) and people zapping through the channels spend more time in the ones that are earlier in the list. 

Two measures of behaviour are used: firstly travel/mobility data, and secondly purchase behaviour. THESE ARE ONLY ONE-DIMENSIONAL ASPECTS OF BEHAVIOUR THOUGH!! Also intra-county variation is not taken into account by aggregating across counties. 

Also a survey is conducted among 1500 people focusing on three dimensions of the pandemic: behaviour, beliefs, and policy preferences. 

The instrument should be both relevant and exogenous. THe relevance is showed by the first stage regressions. 

Now a series of cross sectional IV regressions are performed. Could there be other factors that change over time and also influnece this relationship? Maybe a varying coefficients model would have been cool to implement here. 

Is there a correction for multiple testing in the joint test of significance from March 15-April...?

It could have proved to be even more credible if the authros would have asked an expert what the decisions behind the cable programming/sequence is...

Don't you lose power when you look at days separately. Is there a way to aggregate them? (There is a zero effect on infections and )

Also the monotonicity assumption is not discussed. Is the higher number always worse? Maybe 101 is also logical and people start zapping there (e.g. HD channels).

Moreover, the interpretation in terms of local average treatment effect. Can we extrapolate to people that generally do not watch FOX news. Maybe people that normally do not wathc, would be even more deterred to do social distancing if they watch the network. Is this discussed?

DId they really do a permuation test? THey just throw away data... not really permutation...

Also in claiming that different shows have different stances towards the COVID pandemci, there could be some more evidential claimes. 

This is then also done by subsetting in the survey data. But is there no selection effect in this? Other people might watch these shows?

Can the channel positions be endogenous? CHECK IF THIS IS MENTIONED EXPLICITLY!
